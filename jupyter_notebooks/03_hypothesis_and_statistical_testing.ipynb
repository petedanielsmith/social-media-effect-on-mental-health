    "To explore the hypotheses, I used a combination of ANOVA, chi-square, and correlation tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANOVA**\n",
    "ANOVA is useful when comparing the average value of a numerical variable across several groups, eg. whether stress or sleep differs by platform or mental state. Even though some variables weren’t perfectly normal, the large sample size makes ANOVA robust enough for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chi-square**\n",
    "For relationships between two categorical variables, like platform and mental state, the chi-square test is more appropriate because it checks whether the distribution of categories differs across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation tests**\n",
    "For examining how two numerical variables move together, such as screen time and stress, or negative interactions and stress, I used Pearson and Spearman correlation. Pearson captures linear relationships, while Spearman checks monotonic trends, making them a good pair when the data may not follow perfect linear patterns.\n",

    "These tests cover all the key variable types in the dataset and provide a clear, appropriate way to evaluate the hypotheses."

    "\n",
    "Overall, the statistical tests backed up what I saw in the visual EDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep patterns differed a lot across both age groups and mental-state categories, and platform choice was also linked to clear differences in stress, anxiety, and mood. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a strong association between platform and mental_state, showing that some platforms tend to have more stressed or at-risk users than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also found that higher screen time was strongly related to higher stress, and a higher ratio of negative interactions was moderately linked to stress as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are very consistent, though stronger than what you'd expect in real data, which reflects the synthetic nature of the dataset.\n",
